Improved implementation of the marginal independence test
================

R package `MRCV` is used to analyse data with multiple responses categorical variables and perform statistical tests for their independence. Applying these tests to relative large tables takes a lot of time or leads to errors due to memory limitation. You can find here more efficient computational methods for realizing tests of independence for such type of variables. Details are provided in [this pdf](https://github.com/e-chankov/MItest_improvements/blob/master/Improved%20implementation%20of%20the%20marginal%20independence%20test.pdf).

[This repository](https://github.com/e-chankov/brandsAnalysis) contains shiny application with visualization based on these methods.
